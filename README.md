# Predicting Severity of Illinois Road Accidents

### Problem Statement

The objective of this project is two-fold:

(1) Predict the severity level of accidents.

Severity level can range from 1-4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic (i.e., short delay as a result of the accident) and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic (i.e., long delay).

(2) Identify the factors responsible for accidents of a more severe nature.

Insights can be leveraged to mitigate risks, reduce the number of accidents, related deaths and inconvenience caused due to traffic delays, etc.

There can be various factors that impact accident severity such as weather conditions, location, time of day, road condition/layout (bump, turning loop) etc. Their relationship with severity of accident (response variable) could be highly complicated and would hence allow the opportunity to apply a wide range of algorithms, such as random forests, multinomial logistic regression, gradient boosting, neural networks etc., to train models for prediction as well as inference.

### Motivation

US accidents data has the potential to be used for numerous applications such as:

- Real-time accident prediction

- Studying accident hotspot locations

- Resource planning

- Casualty analysis

- Studying impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence.

We hope to find some meaningful and actionable insights from this project about accident prediction and thus avoidance. Also, the data is quite rich, with almost 3 million records and around 50 features, to provide a considerable challenge to be solved by applying machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the data is collected in real-time, from Feb 2016 to Dec 2019, which is very recent and could potentially make the results of our predictive analytics problem more relevant.
